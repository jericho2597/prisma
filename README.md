# Shared Prisma Schema

A shared Prisma schema that I use for all of my NodeJS web apps that I make, so that they can share a single Planetscale database instance to store data.

This repository is imported into my other repo's as a submodule, so I can make changes for each specific app with their own repository, and then push it back to here.
